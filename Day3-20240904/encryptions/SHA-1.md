# SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
- Purpose: SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value, typically represented as a 40-character hexadecimal number.

- Usage: Historically used for digital certificates, cryptographic applications, and data integrity verification.

- Security: Like MD5, SHA-1 is now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities that allow for hash collisions. It is not recommended for use in secure systems.

- Example:
    - Input: "Hello, World!"
    - SHA-1 Hash: 2ef7bde608ce5404e97d5f042f95f89f1c232871
