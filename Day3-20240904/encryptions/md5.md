# MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)

- Purpose: MD5 was designed to create a 128-bit hash value, commonly represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number.

- Usage: It was widely used for checksums, digital signatures, and to ensure the integrity of files and data.

- Security: MD5 is now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities that allow for hash collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash).

- Example:
    - Input: "Hello, World!"
    - MD5 Hash: 65a8e27d8879283831b664bd8b7f0ad4
