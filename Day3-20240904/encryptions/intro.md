# Introduction to Encryption and Hashing

- Encryption and hashing are fundamental techniques in cryptography, used to secure data. They serve different purposes:

## Encryption: 
- Converts plain text into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect data from unauthorized access. It is a reversible process, meaning the original data can be retrieved using a key.

## Hashing: 
- Transforms input data (like passwords) into a fixed-size string of characters, which typically appears random. Unlike encryption, hashing is a one-way process, meaning you cannot retrieve the original data from the hash.

## Hashing Algorithms:
1. MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)
2. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
3. SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2)
