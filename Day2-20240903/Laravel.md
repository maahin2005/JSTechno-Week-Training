# Laravel Framework Overview

Laravel is a PHP web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. It aims to make the development process enjoyable for developers by easing common tasks such as routing, authentication, and caching.

## Laravel Folder Structure

- Note: some folders we have to create they don't come by default;

1. app
    - The app directory contains the core code of the application. It includes various subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose.

2. Console: Contains custom Artisan commands.
3. Exceptions: Houses exception handling logic.
4. Http: Contains controllers, middleware, and requests. This is where the logic for handling HTTP requests lives.
5. Models: Contains the Eloquent models, representing database tables.
6. Providers: Stores service providers, which are responsible for bootstrapping the application’s core services.
7. bootstrap: The bootstrap directory contains files required for bootstrapping the Laravel framework. This includes the app.php file, which initializes the application.
8. config:The config directory contains all of the application's configuration files. Each file corresponds to a specific component or service, such as database.php for database connections or mail.php for mail settings.

9. database: The database directory houses your database migrations, model factories, and seeds. Migrations define the structure of your database tables, while seeds allow you to populate tables with sample data.

10. public: The public directory is the only directory that should be accessible from the web. It contains the index.php file, which serves as the entry point for all requests, as well as assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

11. resources: The resources directory contains your views, raw assets (such as uncompiled CSS or JavaScript), and language files. The views subdirectory holds the Blade templates that generate HTML responses.

12. routes: The routes directory contains all route definitions for your application. Laravel supports various route files to group routes by purpose, such as web.php for web routes and api.php for API routes.

13. storage: The storage directory stores logs, cached views, sessions, and compiled files. It's also used for storing uploaded files and other application-generated data. This directory should be kept private and not accessible directly from the web.

14. tests: The tests directory contains your automated tests. Laravel provides out-of-the-box support for PHPUnit, allowing you to write unit and feature tests for your application.

15. vendor: The vendor directory is where Composer installs the dependencies of your Laravel application. This directory is managed automatically and should not be modified directly.

16. .env: for setup the enviroments
